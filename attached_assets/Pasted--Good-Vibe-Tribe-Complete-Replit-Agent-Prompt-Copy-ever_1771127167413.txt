# Good Vibe Tribe — Complete Replit Agent Prompt
## Copy everything below the line into Replit Agent

Build a complete, sophisticated nonprofit website for "Good Vibe Tribe" — a Nashville, Tennessee-based community relief nonprofit. This is a full redesign of their existing site (goodvibetribe.info) with elevated, professional design and all original content preserved but rewritten in more polished, trustworthy nonprofit language. The site should look and feel like a nationally recognized, established nonprofit — clean, modern, animated, and emotionally compelling.

COLOR USAGE RULES:
- Primary red (#F83030) → CTA buttons, highlights, urgency, donate buttons, active states
- Secondary green (#18A058) → Success states, program cards, growth themes, secondary buttons
- Dark teal (#1E4E48 / #103030) → Footer, dark overlay sections, nav when scrolled, headings
- Accent gold (#F8F898) → Subtle highlights, decorative elements, badge backgrounds
- Section backgrounds alternate: white → bg-cream → white → bg-dark → white → bg-light
- Cards and buttons should use red OR green (never both on same element)
- Dark sections use teal backgrounds with white/cream text

============================
LOGO
============================
- The logo file is "Logo__2_.png" — place it in /images/ folder
- Use it in the navbar (left side) at approximately 50px height
- Use it in the footer
- The logo is circular with "THE GOOD VIBE TRIBE" text around the top and "NASHVILLE" at the bottom, with a stylized red lotus/tribal flower and green leaves in the center
- On transparent/white backgrounds the logo works as-is
- On dark backgrounds, the logo still works since it has its own teal background built in

============================
TYPOGRAPHY
============================
- Headings (h1-h3, nav links, buttons): font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
- Body text (p, li, card text, descriptions): font-family: 'Figtree', sans-serif;

CRITICAL NOTES
============================
1. Single index.html + style.css + script.js — simple Replit structure
2. All content above is FINAL — no lorem ipsum anywhere
3. The design should feel warm, genuine, faith-informed but NOT overly religious — welcoming to ALL
4. Emphasis on community, togetherness, authenticity, and Nashville pride
5. The site should feel like an established, trustworthy nonprofit — NOT a startup or personal blog
6. Every section should have smooth scroll-triggered animations
7. Donation forms are functional UI (toggles, amount selection) even without payment processing
8. Mobile experience must be excellent — hamburger animation, touch-friendly, responsive grids
9. Font Awesome icons throughout for visual richness
10. Preloader animation: fade-out with logo after 1.2 seconds
11. ALL BRAND COLORS MUST MATCH THE LOGO: Red #F83030, Green #18A058, Teal #1E4E48/#103030
